# ZEPTO_DATA_ANALYSIS_WITH_SQL
Analysing the Zepto dataset sourced from Kaggle with the help of SQL

## Project Overview
The goal is to simulate how actual data analysts in the e-commerce or retail industries work behind the scenes to use SQL to:

* Set up a messy, real-world e-commerce inventory database

* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to explore product categories, availability, and pricing inconsistencies

* Implement Data Cleaning to handle null values, remove invalid entries, and convert pricing from paise to rupees

* Write business-driven SQL queries to derive insights around pricing, inventory, stock availability, revenue and more


## Dataset Overview
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and was originally scraped from Zepto’s official product listings. It mimics what you’d typically encounter in a real-world e-commerce inventory system.

Each row represents a unique SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) for a product. Duplicate product names exist because the same product may appear multiple times in different package sizes, weights, discounts, or categories to improve visibility – exactly how real catalog data looks.

Columns:

1. sku_id: Unique identifier for each product entry (Synthetic Primary Key)
2. name: Product name as it appears on the app
3. category: Product category like Fruits, Snacks, Beverages, etc.
4. mrp: Maximum Retail Price (originally in paise, converted to ₹)
5. discountPercent: Discount applied on MRP
6. discountedSellingPrice: Final price after discount (also converted to ₹)
7. availableQuantity: Units available in inventory
8. weightInGms: Product weight in grams
9. outOfStock: Boolean flag indicating stock availability
10. quantity: Number of units per package (mixed with grams for loose produce)

#Project Workflow

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we do in this project:

## 1. Creating a Database and Table
  Create a SQL Database and Table named Zepto

CREATE TABLE zepto (
  sku_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  category VARCHAR(120),
  name VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
  mrp NUMERIC(8,2),
  discountPercent NUMERIC(5,2),
  availableQuantity INTEGER,
  discountedSellingPrice NUMERIC(8,2),
  weightInGms INTEGER,
  outOfStock BOOLEAN,
  quantity INTEGER
);

## 2. Data Import
  * Loaded CSV using pgAdmin's import feature

## 3. Data Exploration

  * Counted the total number of records in the dataset
  * Viewed a sample of the dataset to understand structure and content
  * Checked for null values across all columns
  * Identified distinct product categories available in the dataset
  * Compared in-stock vs out-of-stock products
    
## 4. Data Cleaning
  * Identified and removed rows where MRP or discounted selling price was zero
  * Converted MRP and discountedsellingprice from paise to rupees for consistency and readability

## 5. Business Insights
  * Found top 10 best-value products based on discount percentage
  * Identified high-MRP products that are currently out of stock
  * Estimated potential revenue for each product category
  * Filtered expensive products (MRP > ₹500) with minimal discount
  * Ranked top 5 categories offering highest average discounts
  * Calculated price per gram to identify value-for-money products
  * Grouped products based on weight into Low, Medium, and Bulk categories
  * Measured total inventory weight per product category


Thanks for chekcing out the project.
